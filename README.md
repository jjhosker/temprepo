Temporary repository
Test repository
##  Git is local; GitHub is remote.
##  GitHub allows you to:
##   o	Share repositories with others
##   o	Access other users' repositories
##   o	Store remote copies of your repositories in case something happens to your computer
##   o	Allows remote access to your work

## Both Git and GitHub refer to this as a repository, or “repo” for short, a digital directory or 
## storage space where you can access your project, its files, and 
## all the versions of its files that Git saves
